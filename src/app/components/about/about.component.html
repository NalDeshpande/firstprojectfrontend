<p> To share and grow the world’s knowledge. Not all knowledge can be written down, but much of that which can be, still isn't.

     knowledge to the people who need it, to bring together people with different perspectives so they can understand each 
     other better, and to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.</p>
